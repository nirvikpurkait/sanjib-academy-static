# 🚀 scrapnity

A modern frontend project built with **Tanstack Roter (Vite) + React + TypeScript**, enhanced with the **React Compiler**, and automated deployment using **GitHub Actions**.

---

## 📦 Tech Stack

- ⚡ Tanstack Roter (Vite)
- ⚛️ React
- 🟦 TypeScript
- 🧠 React Compiler
- 📦 pnpm (package manager)
- 🔁 GitHub Actions (CI/CD)
- 🌐 FTP Deployment (Hostinger)

---

## 🛠️ Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/indiglobe/scrapnity.git
cd scrapnity
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

This project uses **pnpm**, so make sure it's installed:

```bash
npm install -g pnpm
```

Then install dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

### 3. Start Development Server

```bash
pnpm dev
```

---

## 🏗️ Build

To generate production files:

```bash
pnpm build
```

Preview the build:

```bash
pnpm preview
```

---

## 🤖 Deployment (Automated)

⚠️ **Important for new developers:**

You **DO NOT** need to manually upload build files to the server.

Deployment is fully automated using **GitHub Actions**.

### 🔄 How It Works

- On push to the configured branch (e.g. `main`)
- GitHub Actions runs the build
- Generated files (`dist/`) are automatically uploaded to the server

This is handled using:

```yaml
uses: SamKirkland/FTP-Deploy-Action@v4.3.6
```

### 🌐 Hosting

- Deployment target: **Hostinger (FTP server)**
- Files are uploaded directly via FTP during CI/CD

## ⚙️ GitHub Actions (CI/CD)

A typical workflow:

1. Install dependencies using pnpm
2. Build the project
3. Deploy `dist/client` to server via FTP

---

## 📌 Notes for Developers

- ❌ Do NOT manually upload files to the server
- ❌ Do NOT edit anything inside the `dist/client` folder
- ✅ Always push changes to the repository
- ✅ Deployment will happen automatically

---

## 🔐 Environment Variables

If your project uses environment variables:

- Create a `.env` file locally
- Add required variables
- Ensure secrets are configured in GitHub Actions for deployment

---

## 🧩 Useful Scripts

```json
{
  "dev": "vite dev --port 3000",
  "build": "vite build",
  "preview": "vite preview"
}
```
